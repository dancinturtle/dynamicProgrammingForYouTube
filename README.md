# dynamicProgrammingForYouTube

I started looking into dynamic programming a few years ago when I was preparing for technical interviews. It seemed really scary at first, but soon I was hooked!

Everything that I cover in this notebook is taken lovingly and with great gratitude from this amazing post: [Top 50 Dynamic Programming Practice Problems](https://medium.com/techie-delight/top-50-dynamic-programming-practice-problems-4208fed71aa3)

The only thing I can add to the very thorough explanations provided are some badly drawn diagrams, which I found instrumental to making everything click in my mind.

My goal is to provide YouTube videos for all 50 problems. 

The playlist can be found here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtvVHoBlZ6udlTsxBYEcbJkQK7mp6tri3

These notebooks are simply the product of making said videos.
